We started working on our project before break and split the tasks up into three categories: offer forms, homepage, and server + database. For offer forms, we wanted to validate input on the client and send it to the server. For the homepage, we wanted to have a responsive site, and different data displayed for restaurants and clients. For server + database, we want to have it receive offers from the post functionality and be able to send them back to the client.

#Done so Far:

    - offer forms
        - client-side implemented
    - homepage
        - basic listing of offers
        - map centered on your location
    - server + database
        - url = c20t3fdb.herokuapp.com
        - routes defined, not implemented

#Challenges:

    - offer forms:
        - needs validation from server
    - homepage
        - working on responsive
    - server
        - working on routes/database
        - getting git and heroku to communicate
            - solution: needed to make new git repository

#For Next Week:

    - offer forms:
        - server-validated
    - homepage:
        - display offers from server
        - responsive to mobile screen sizes
