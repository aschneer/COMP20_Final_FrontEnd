Progress made this week:
1. node.js server was set up and is now running
2. Restaurants can now successfully post food offers to the server via form
3. Front end layout: index page is now more responsive (elements stack when browser is resized)

Challenges faced over the past week:
1. Using Map's address API to validate addresses on client side
2. Difficulty implementing collapsible menu for portable devices
3. Stacking yet to completely properly work

Goals for next week:
1. Make site completely responsive
2. Create css file for web-pages
3. Implement address validation on client side
4. Link website pages

1. "Stacking yet to completely properly work" --what's stacking?
2. Where's status report 3?
3. It seems like you are focusing a lot on client-side / styling stuff...
