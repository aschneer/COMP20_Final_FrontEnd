For Spring Break, each of us will take one of the tasks below and work on it on our own branch named 'YOURNAME'. We made some mockup data in a file called 'data.js' in the site/js folder. Use this to mockup displaying any data you might need. When we get back we'll sit down and get all the code into one branch.

Tasks:
- web form for inputing food (_Barry_)
	- validate
		- time
		- address
	- convert address to {lat, lng}
	- update map with items
- geolocation handling (_Andrew_? if you'd rather do displaying items just let hunter know)
	- reset origin to clicked restaurant
	- highlight restaurants on map
		- with color indicating how soon it is
- mobile/desktop views (_Sibonay_)
	- Food Ticker position
		- Side for desktop
		- under map for mobile
- displaying items (_Hunter_?)
	- sort by 
		- distance
		- time

- somethings to do later:
	- dismiss items
		- swipe on mobile
		- click 'X' on desktop
